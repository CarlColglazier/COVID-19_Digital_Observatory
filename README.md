# COVID-19 Digital Observatory
The COVID-19 Digital Observatory collects, aggregates, and distributes data from social media, search engine results, and Wikipedia to support social and data science research related to the pandemic.

The [community data science collective](https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page "The community data science collective wiki") is the early stages of building this project. We expect to make rapid progess and to begin releasing code and data soon.

We eagerly welcome contributors! Please get in touch. 
Contributors are held to the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md "link to code of conduct.md").
