# COVID-19 Digital Observatory
The [COVID-19 Digital Observatory](https://covid19.communitydata.science "Covid-19 Digital Observatory homepage") collects, aggregates, and distributes data from social media, search engine results, and Wikipedia to support immediate public health response and social and data science research related to the pandemic.

The [community data science collective](https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page "The community data science collective wiki") is working with [Pushshift](https://pushshift.io) and others to build this project. We expect to make rapid progess and to release additional code and data soon.

Also, please note that contributors are held to the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md "link to code of conduct.md").
